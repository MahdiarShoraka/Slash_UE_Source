The Source Code Repository for **Slash**, an Unreal Engine 5 Action Adventure Game MVP.

This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in crafting clean, scalable C++ code and implementing complex game logic and mechanics.

Throughout the development process, I focused on utilizing Unreal Engine 5's powerful frameworks and systems to create a professional and polished gameplay experience.

This project was part of my coursework from the Unreal Engine 5: The Ultimate Game Developer Course on Udemy, and I developed this code alongside this course. (https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course)
